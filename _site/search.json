    "text": "Overview\nA fundmental concept in R Shiny is reactivity. Reactivity refers to the automatic responsiveness and dynamic behavior of the application based on user input and data changes. It allows the application to update and re-render specific parts of the user interface (UI) in response to changes in input values, data updates, or other reactive triggers.\nAll Shiny apps have an element of reactivity. In a basic Shiny app like we say in the last module, reactivity occurs when user input is fed to the server function through functions like renderPlot() or renderTable(). But we might also want to add additional elements of reactivity by using reactive functions like reactive() or observe(). In this lesson, we are going to look at how to use the reactive() function to control two separate reactive inputs to a line chart: the indicator the user wishes to view and the date range that the way to view it for. Here is the app that we are going to be building:"

    "text": "Setup\n\nIn the setup portion of our we want to start by loading the packages we will need to build the app. For this app, we are going to be using the fredr package to download data pertaining to the overall health of the economy from the St. Louis Fed’s Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/] API. So here we will also set our FRED API key and assign the codes for the indicators that we want to download to objects.\nNext, we will use the as.Date() function to set the start date of our line series to Januar 1, 1970 and the end date as today’s date (system date). We will also create a list of variable names for our UI dropdown (vars) and relate them to the objects containing the indicator codes.\nFinally, we are going to be using a helper function to generate recession shading for our charts. Scroll down to the bottom of this page to see the code for the helper function. Take this and save it in an R file and put it in your app folder. In this chunk, we are going to call it with the source function, e.g. source(helper.R).\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(fredr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Set Fred API key \nfredr_set_key(\"YOUR FRED API KEY\") \n\n# Assign FRED series to objects\ncci &lt;- \"CSCICP03USM665S\" # consumer confidence\nbci &lt;- \"BSCICP03USM665S\" # business confidence\ncli &lt;- \"USALOLITONOSTSAM\" # composite lead indicator\nunemp_rate &lt;- \"UNRATE\" # unemployment rate\ngrowth &lt;- \"A191RL1Q225SBEA\" # growth rate\n\n# set start and end date\nstart_date &lt;- as.Date(\"1970-01-01\")\nend_date &lt;- as.Date(Sys.Date())\n\n# Create list of named values for the input selection\nvars &lt;- c(\"Consumer Confidence\" = cci, \n          \"Business Confidence\" = bci, \n          \"Composite Indicator\" = cli, \n          \"Unemployment Rate\" = unemp_rate,\n          \"Growth Rate\" = growth)\n\n# Load helper script\nsource(\"helper.R\") # scroll down, code pasted below"

    "section": "UI",
    "text": "UI\n\nNow we can get started on developing the UI for our app. For this app, we are going to have a title panel and two main display elements. The first is a panel where the user can select the indicator that they want to chart and the second is a plot with a slider where users can select the years they want to view. So let’s divide the UI into two sections using the fluidRow() and column()\nThe fluidRow() function creates horizontal containers while the column() function is used to create vertical containers. Since we our app is going to display a single row, we will have just one fluidRow() call. Then we can divide that row into two columns using the column() function. The first argument in column()is the column width. Since column widths in Shiny are based on the Boots Bootstrap 12-wide grid system, our column widths must add up to 12. So let’s make our panel for selecting the indicator 4 units wide and the area where we will display the plot 8 units wide.\nFrom there, we can define the panel as a wellPanel() to give it an inset look and a grey background. We include selectInput() to get our dropdown where users can select an indicator from the vars list. Let’s also use the helpText() function to display some instructions regarding how to use the app.\nFor the main display section, we are going to have our plot out along with the slider input. We are going to call this input “range” and leave the label blank. Then we need to define a min value, a max value and a range for the slider. For min and max, we will use start_date and end_date, which we defined earlier in the setup and the combination of these to define the range (value). Then we set width to 100% because we want the slider to expand to fit the entire width of the plot. `\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"FRED Data App\"),\n    \n    fluidRow(\n      \n      # 12 columns on one row: this panel will take 1/3 of it\n      column(4, wellPanel(\n        selectInput(\"indicator\", \"Indicator:\", vars)\n        ),\n      helpText(\"Select an indicator, choose a date range and view the trend. \n               The grey bars represent economic recessions. \n               The data for this app comes from the St. Louis Fed's \n               FRED database.

    "section": "Server",
    "text": "Server\n\nFor our server function, we are going to define two separate reactive() functions. This is how we are going to dynamically update the plot based on two different user inputs. First, we will define an input for the indicator where input$indicator takes the user input from the dropdown menu to perform a fresh API call whenever the selected indicator changes. Then, we take that input and filter it based on the input from the slider, e.g. input$range. Then we render the plot based on these updated data.\nNotice that whenever we want to use the stored data from the reactive calls we need to add parentheses after the objects, e.g. fred_indicator() in the second reactive function or fred_data() in the ggplot call. This is to ensure that the reactive expression is evaluated and its current value is used as the input data for the plot.\nFinally, we are going to use the add_rec_shade() helper function to add the recession shading to the chart. We again use the inputs from the two reactive functions to define the start date and end date of the shading as well as the y-min and y-max values of the shaded rectangles.\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  \n    # Download data from FRED with reactive function. \n    # Only updates when user selects new indicator\n    fred_indicator &lt;- reactive({\n      fredr(series_id = input$indicator,\n        observation_start = start_date,\n        observation_end = end_date)\n    })\n  \n    # Filter data according to chosen years \n    # Only updates when user selects new data range\n    fred_data &lt;- reactive({\n      fred_indicator() |&gt;\n      filter(between(date, input$range[1],input$range[2])) \n   })\n\n    # Render line chart\n    output$lineChart &lt;- renderPlot({\n      \n      # Build plot with ggplot2\n      ggplot(fred_data(), aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n        geom_line(color = \"navyblue\") +\n        labs(\n          x = \"\", \n          y =  names(vars[which(vars == input$indicator)])\n        ) +\n        theme_minimal() +\n        # add recession shading\n        add_rec_shade(st_date = input$range[1], \n                      ed_date = input$range[2], \n                      shade_color = \"darkgrey\",\n                      y_min = min(fred_data()$value),\n                      y_max = max(fred_data()$value))\n    })\n}"

    "text": "Once you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown.

    "text": "Once you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown.

As we saw in the last lesson, importing and wrangling data from flat files can be a messy process. So when clean data are available for download, we want to be able to take advantage of that. Luckily there are some pretty good R packages that allow us to extract data from open source APIs. We are going to be working with two of those in this module (wbstats and vdemdata) and some others later in the course.\nAlong the way, we are going to continue to extend our data wrangling skills. We will learn some new functions in dplyr and janitor that will help us get our data into a usable form for analysis. We are also going to cover in depth some common data science workflows, including filtering observations, selecting variables, merging two data sets, summarizing data for different groups, and sorting data based on column values.\nThe end goal is to have a nice dataset with a combination of World Bank and V-Dem Institute data that we can use to illustrate the relationship between the economy, democracy and women’s empowerment."

    "text": "Downloading data from an API\n\nYou will no doubt remember the messy data that we downloaded from the World Bank’s website in module 1.1. Usually it is much easier to download data from an API as opposed to wrangling it from a .csv file. In this example, I want to illustrate that for you by having you download the same data that we worked with in the last module using the wbstats package.\nFirst we are going to load wbstats along with dplyr and janitor. The wb_data() function is the one we need to download the data from the World Bank’s API. wb_data() requires to main sets of arguments: a list of indicators that we want to use and the period for which we want to download data. The period can can be entered as two separate arguments (e.g. start_date and end_date). But for this exercise we will specify the number of years we want to download using mrv which stands for “most recent value.”\nIn addition to female labor force participation, let’s also grab the percentage of seats in parliament held by women. We will store that list of objects in a vector called women_emp to signify that these indicators are related to women’s empowerment. We will try to download 50 years of data for these two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to search World Bank data for additional indicators, you can use the wb_search() function. For example, if we wanted to find all of the indicators associated with female labor force participation, we could run:\n\nflfp_indicators &lt;- wb_search(\"female labor force\") # store the list of indicators\n\nprint(flfp_indicators, n=26) # view the indicators\n\nTry searching for some indicators related to a topic you are interested in and see what you get!\n\n\nWhile we are calling wb_data() we will go ahead and pipe some additional functions from dplyr and janitor to clean it up. First, we will use select() to eliminate the iso2c variable, which we won’t be needing. Then, we will rename date to year. Then we will use a combination of mutate and round_to_fraction() to round the data to the nearest hundredth.\nWe will pipe all of these functions together and store the resulting data frame in a new object called women_emp.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(wbstats) # for downloading WB data\nlibrary(dplyr) # for selecting, renaming and mutating\nlibrary(janitor) # for rounding\n\n# Store the list of indicators in an object\nindicators &lt;- c(\"flfp\" = \"SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\", \"women_rep\" = \"SG.GEN.PARL.ZS\") \n\n# Download the data  \nwomen_emp &lt;- wb_data(indicators, mrv = 50) |&gt; # download data for last 50 yrs\n  select(!iso2c) |&gt; # drop the iso2c code which we won't be using\n  rename(year = date) |&gt; # rename date to year \n  mutate(\n    flfp = round_to_fraction(flfp, denominator = 100), # round to nearest 100th\n    women_rep = round_to_fraction(women_rep, denominator = 100) \n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(women_emp) \n\nRows: 7,161\nColumns: 5\n$ iso3c     &lt;chr&gt; \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW…\n$ country   &lt;chr&gt; \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba…\n$ year      &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, …\n$ women_rep &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ flfp      &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n\n\nNow we have some pretty tidy World Bank data related to women’s empowerment without having to do too much work. I am sure you would agree that this is a much more straightforward process than downloading the data and then importing the data as a flat file!\nOne thing that becomes very clear here is that wb_data() did not download any data before 1990. It automatically filtered out the years for which all countries had no data. The fact there were no data before 1990 for any of the countries is easily missed when we were simply importing it from a .csv file."

We also delve more into the topic of how to create new variables. To illustrate these concepts, we are going to be working with the V-Dem Dataset. The V-Dem offers an R package for downloading its data called vdemdata.\nvdemdata is perfect for illustrating the filter() and select() verbs because its main function for downloading the data (vdem) does not take any arguments (it simply downloads the whole dataset). So you have to use R functions to narrow down the variables and years you want to work with.\nWhile V-Dem has wealth of indicators related to democracy, we are going to focus on the most famous one called the “polyarchy” score. We are also going to download data on per capita GDP and create some indicator variables for region that we will use later on when we summarize the data. Along with those variables, we also want to retain country_name, year and country_id for the purposes of merging these data with our World Bank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile V-Dem has a variable look-up tool (find_var), it does not provide very much information on the variables that the search function returns. Therefore, if you want to use this package for your own research, I highly recommend just going to the V-Dem codebook and manually grabbing the codes for the indicators that you want to use in your analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to filtering out years and selecting variables, let’s also create a region coding to facilitate our analysis later on. We will do this by piping in a mutate() call where we use the case_match() function to change the region from a numeric variable to a string. This will come in handy when we go to visualize the data in future lessons.\nWe will store our new data as an object called democracy.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data\n\n# Download the data\ndemocracy &lt;- vdem |&gt; # download the V-Dem dataset\n  filter(year &gt;= 1990)  |&gt; # filter out years less than 1990\n  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables\n    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  \n    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name\n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, \n    region = e_regionpol_6C\n    ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with names\n                     1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                     2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                     3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                     4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                     5 ~ \"The West\", \n                     6 ~ \"Asia\")\n                    # number on the left of the ~ is the V-Dem region code\n                    # we are changing the number to the country name on the right\n                    # of the equals sign\n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 5,846\nColumns: 6\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.418, 0.441, 0.451, 0.472, 0.489, 0.511, 0.560, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…"

    "text": "Add country codes to a data frame\n\nOne common problem scholars face when they want to analyze country-level data is the fact that datasets use different country codes. This can make it challenging to combine datasets, thus limiting the potential scope of our analysis. Lucikly, there is a wonderful package called countrycode that can help to solve this problem.\nThe countrycode() function creates a new country code variable in our dataset that matches the country code variable of the second dataset that we are trying to merge it to. countrycode() takes three arguments: sourcevar; origin; and destination. sourcevar identifies the name of the column that you want to transform, origin is the coding system that you want to translate from, and destination is the coding system that you want to translate to.\nIn this next step of our analysis, we are going to join the World Bank and V-Dem data that we wrangled into a single dataset. To do that we need a common country code. The way we are going to do this is to create a new country code variable in the democracy dataset that matches the one in the women’s empowerment dataset.\nLet’s create a new version of our democracy dataset where we add a variable called iso3c. We will call mutate() to create the variable and wrap the countrycode() call inside of that. The sourcevar that we want to transform is the vdem_ctry_id, the origin code is “vdem”, and the destination code is “wb”.\nWe are also going to pipe in a relocate() call which simply moves the new iso3c column from the end of the data frame (where R automically drops it) so that it sits right next to vdem_ctry_cd. This is not essential but it is always good to keep our data frames looking nice and neat!.\n\n# Load countrycode\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\n# Create new iso3c variable\ndemocracy &lt;- democracy |&gt;    \n  mutate(iso3c = countrycode(sourcevar = vdem_ctry_id, # what we are converting\n        origin = \"vdem\",         # we are converting from vdem\n        destination = \"wb\"))  |&gt; # and converting to the WB iso3c code \n  relocate(iso3c, .after = vdem_ctry_id) # move iso3c \n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 5,846\nColumns: 7\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ iso3c        &lt;chr&gt; \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"…\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.418, 0.441, 0.451, 0.472, 0.489, 0.511, 0.560, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…"

    "text": "Merge two data frames\n\nNow that we have a common country code, we can join the two data sets. There are many different types of joins. First there is a distinction between mutating joins, which add observations from one dataset to another, and filtering joins, which filter out observations based on their presence or absence in another dataset. Here we are going to be focused on mutating joins.\nThere are four kinds of mutating joins we can do in dplyr. An inner_join() keeps only the observations that are common in both datasets that you want to merge. A full_join() does the opposite. It keeps all of the observations present in both datasets regardless of whether or not they have a match. A left_join() keeps all of the observations in dataset \\(x\\) and only the matching observations in dataset \\(y\\). A right_join() does the same thing, but instead keeps all of the observations from dataset \\(y\\) and only matching observations from dataset \\(x\\).\nWe are going to use left_join() to merge our two datasets. left_join() takes three essential arguments: \\(x\\); \\(y\\); and \\(by\\) which identifies the column that we want to join on. For this exercise, the \\(x\\) dataset is going to be the democracy dataset, the \\(y\\) dataset is the women empowerment dataset, and we want to join on both the “iso3c” and “year” columns.\nWhen dplyr does a join, it renames any duplicate columns with suffixes like .x or .y. In our data, country is a duplicate column across the democracy and women’s empowerment datasets. So dplyr renames these country.x and country.y.

First, we group the data by certain value or category. Then we summarize it by applying a function like min(), max(), mean(), median() or sd(). Finally, we order the data according to column values.\nLet’s go ahead and apply our three new verbs to the dem_women data frame and store the resulting new data frame in an object called dem_summary. We will group the data by region, take the mean of each variable, and sort the data in descending order based on the regions’ polyarchy scores. Then we will print the object to view its contents.

In this lesson, we are going to focus on one of them that I think is particularly good for both pdf and html output: modelsummary. modelsummary also includes a function (modelplot()) for plotting point estimates and confidence intervals. So part of the objective of this lesson is going to be to learn when you should use a table to present your regression results versus when you should use a plot.\nWe will be taking our example from the peace studies literature. We are going to download data using the peacesciencer package and use it to partially reproduce a famous analysis of conflict onset by Fearon and Laitin."

We will specify system = 'gw' to denote the Gleditsch-Ward country coding system. Then we will filter for roughly the same years of Fearon and Laitin’s original analysis (1945-99) with the caveat that peacesciencer only has conflict data starting in 1946.\nThen we add a bunch of data to the data frame using the various add_X functions available in the package. Here we add UCDP conflict data which includes our dependent variable for this analysis–conflict onset. Then we add measures of democracy, ethno-religious fractionalization, GDP and terrain.\n\nlibrary(peacesciencer)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nconflict_df &lt;- create_stateyears(system = 'gw') |&gt;\n  filter(year %in% c(1946:1999)) |&gt;\n  add_ucdp_acd(type=c(\"intrastate\"), only_wars = FALSE) |&gt;\n  add_democracy() |&gt;\n  add_creg_fractionalization() |&gt;\n  add_sdp_gdp() |&gt;\n  add_rugged_terrain()\n\nglimpse(conflict_df)\n\nRows: 7,036\nColumns: 20\n$ gwcode         &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2…\n$ statename      &lt;chr&gt; \"United States of America\", \"United States of America\",…\n$ year           &lt;dbl&gt; 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1…\n$ ucdpongoing    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ ucdponset      &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ maxintensity   &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ conflict_ids   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ v2x_polyarchy  &lt;dbl&gt; 0.605, 0.587, 0.599, 0.599, 0.587, 0.602, 0.601, 0.594,…\n$ polity2        &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,…\n$ xm_qudsest     &lt;dbl&gt; 1.259180, 1.259180, 1.252190, 1.252190, 1.270106, 1.259…\n$ ethfrac        &lt;dbl&gt; 0.2226323, 0.2248701, 0.2271561, 0.2294918, 0.2318781, …\n$ ethpol         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.4152487, 0.4186156, 0.4220368, 0.4255134, 0.4290458, …\n$ relfrac        &lt;dbl&gt; 0.4980802, 0.5009111, 0.5037278, 0.5065309, 0.5093204, …\n$ relpol         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.7769888, 0.7770017, 0.7770303, 0.7770729, 0.7771274, …\n$ wbgdp2011est   &lt;dbl&gt; 28.539, 28.519, 28.545, 28.534, 28.572, 28.635, 28.669,…\n$ wbpopest       &lt;dbl&gt; 18.744, 18.756, 18.781, 18.804, 18.821, 18.832, 18.848,…\n$ sdpest         &lt;dbl&gt; 28.478, 28.456, 28.483, 28.469, 28.510, 28.576, 28.611,…\n$ wbgdppc2011est &lt;dbl&gt; 9.794, 9.762, 9.764, 9.730, 9.752, 9.803, 9.821, 9.857,…\n$ rugged         &lt;dbl&gt; 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073,…\n$ newlmtnest     &lt;dbl&gt; 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214…\n\n\nNow let’s go ahead and run the analysis. We will specify a logit model using the glm() function and specifying family = binomial(link = \"logit\"). We will store our model in an object called conflict_model. And from there we can use the tidy() function from the broom package to view the results.\nBefore doing this, though, try calling summary() from base R on the model. This provides us with a basic regression table and it is great insofar as we don’t want to do anything else with these estimates. Next, go ahead and call View() on the model object of just click on it to see what it looks like. You will notice that the results are stored in a complicated list format.\nThe tidy() function enables us to take the results from this list and store them in a “tibble”, which is the Tidyverse equivalent of a data frame. Once the results are stored like this, we can easily access the estimates for anything that we might want to do with them including combining the results of different models or displaying particular estimates in our document using all of the tools that we have learned in this course. We can also set conf.int = TRUE) as an argument in tidy() to create and store confidence intervals.\nBy default, tidy() returns p-values with large numbers of digits following the decimal point, making hard to tell whether the variables are significant. To fix this, we can pipe our tidy() output into a mutate_if() call and specify that we want numeric output to round to five decimal places.\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\nconflict_model &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ ethfrac + relfrac + v2x_polyarchy + \n                        rugged + wbgdppc2011est + wbpopest,\n                  data= conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\n# summary(conflict_model)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- conflict_model |&gt;\n  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 5)\n\ntidy_model\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 7\n  term           estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)     -5.69      1.41      -4.04  0.00005  -8.44      -2.92 \n2 ethfrac          0.800     0.381      2.10  0.0356    0.0670     1.56 \n3 relfrac         -0.391     0.417     -0.939 0.348    -1.22       0.420\n4 v2x_polyarchy   -0.602     0.509     -1.18  0.237    -1.61       0.387\n5 rugged           0.0641    0.0760     0.843 0.399    -0.0923     0.207\n6 wbgdppc2011est  -0.372     0.121     -3.08  0.00204  -0.613     -0.140\n7 wbpopest         0.293     0.0673     4.35  0.00001   0.162      0.426\n\n\nHow did we do relative to Fearon and Latin’s original analysis. Well, one thing that F&L were pretty certain about is that ethnic and religious fractionalization do not matter for conflict onset. But here we find a statistically significant relationship between these variables and conflict onset. But one thing we do find in common with their analysis is the importance of wealth and population. Both of these variables are significant in the expected direction. Wealthier countries experience less risk of conflict onset while more populous ones have a higher risk."

One package that is really good at producing professional-looking tabels is modelsummary and one of its strongest features is the ability to combine multiple models into the same table while still allowing for substantial customization.\nLet’s go ahead and store four models. In the first three, we will feature sets of predictors (ethnicity, democracy and terrain) and then a final model that includes all of our predictors.

Then we will store a new coefficient mapping where we rename our variables and change the order that they will appear in the table. We will also store a title and a reference.\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\"Ethnicity\" = ethnicity,  # store list of models in an object\n               \"Democracy\" = democracy, \n               \"Terrain\" = terrain, \n               \"Full Model\" = full_model)\n\ncoef_map &lt;- c(\"ethfrac\" = \"Ethnic Frac\",  # map coefficients\n        \"relfrac\" = \"Religions Frac\",     #(change names and order)\n        \"v2x_polyarchy\" = \"Polyarchy\",\n        \"rugged\" = \"Terrain\",\n        \"wbgdppc2011est\" = \"Per capita GDP\",\n        \"wbpopest\" = \"Population\",\n        \"(Intercept)\" = \"Intercept\")\n\ncaption = \"Table 1: Predictors of Conflict Onset\" # store caption\nreference = \"See appendix for data sources.\"      # store reference notes\n\nNow we can call modelsummary().

A better option could be to display a coefficient plot that shows point estimates and confidence intervals. This is often preferable with one model because it makes our results so much easier to interpret.\nLet’s try making a coefficient plot with modelplot() from the modelsummary package. The syntax for modelplot() is very similar to that of modelsummary() but there are a few small differences.\nFirst, it puts maps the coefficients from the bottom up, so if you to maintain the order of the coefficients you need to reverse the mapping. We do this with the rev() function.\nSecond, we want to omit the intercept with coef_omit = \"Intercept\" because the emphasis in a coefficient plot is less on the exact regression equation and more on the magnitude and significance of the coefficients.\nThird we can customize various things. We can specify the color of the points and confidence intervals and we can load ggplot2 for further customization. Now we can add geoms and labels just like any other ggplot object. Here we add a red vertical intercept line at zero to make it clearer which variables are significant (e.g. the confidence interval does not overlap with zero). And we add a title and a caption using the labs() function.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nmodelplot(conflict_model, \n          coef_map = rev(coef_map), # rev() reverses list order\n          coef_omit = \"Intercept\", \n          color = \"blue\") + # use plus to add customizations like any ggplot object\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = .75) + # red 0 line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Figure 1: Predictors of Conflict Onset\",\n    caption = \"See appendix for data sources.\"\n  )"

    "title": "Module 2.2",
    "section": "Color schemes",
    "text": "Color schemes\n\nThere are a number of different types of color blindness, but the most common type is red-green color blindness. Making your visualizations colorblind-accessible can be important for convincing certain audiences. Most notably, approximately 8% of men are affected by color blindness.\nLet’s start off by looking at the line chart that we did in the last module pertaining to Huntington’s three waves of democratization:\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\ndem_waves_chart &lt;- ggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\"\n  )\n\ndem_waves_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with this plot is that people with red-green color blindness will not be able to distinguish between the lines for Japan and Portungal. There are many tools that we could use to see how this is true, but here we are going to focus on the color vision deficiency (CVD) simulator from the colorBlindness package. To use it, all we have to do is load colorBlindness and call cvdPlot() on the stored plot.\n\nlibrary(colorBlindness)\n\ncvdPlot(dem_waves_chart)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this output, we can see how deuteranopia and protonopia (red-green color blindness) would experience our plot. Notice how hard it is to distinguish between Japan and Portugal here. We can also see how someone with monochromatic vision would see the plot by looking at the “desaturated (BW)” plot. While monochromatic vision is very rare, we can use this plot to make adjustments for a worst-case scenario.\nSo once you determine that your color scheme is not colorblind friendly, what should you do? There are two basic solutions available to you: making your own colorblind friendly color scheme or use a package that produces colorblind-friendly schemes for you.\nCreate your own colorblind-friendly color scheme\nThe first way to make your plot more accessible is to create your own discrete scale using scale_fill_manual() or scale_color_manual() (depending on what type of plot you are trying to draw).\nLet’s try using an example color scheme from the R Cookbook to fill in the bars of a column chart. Here we will make use of the regional levels of female labor force participation data that we prepped in the prework section of this module. First we create a vector of colors called cb_palette. Then we build our bar chart and save it as an object called flfp_region. Crucially, when we perform our ggplot call, we include fill = region as a third dimension in our aes() function. This is in addition to including the region code iso3c on the x-axis. Finally, we use our palette to shade our bars using scale_fill_manual().\n\ncb_palette &lt;- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\nflfp_region &lt;- ggplot(flfp_gdp_regions, aes(x = reorder(iso3c, -flfp), y = flfp, fill = region)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Female Labor Force Participation\", \n    title = \"Levels of female labor force participation by region\", \n    fill = \"Region\",\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank\"\n    ) \n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_manual(values = cb_palette)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can check our visualization using the cvdPlot() function from the colorBlindness package.\n\nflfp_region &lt;- flfp_region + scale_fill_manual(values = cb_palette)\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it would still be difficult for a person with red-green color blindness to see some of the colors in the chart (like the pink of SSF or the bright green of LAC), it would still be possible for them to distinguish the colors of the bars based on what would appear to them as shades of grey.\nUse viridis\nAnother option is to use a package designed with accessibility issues in mind. One of the more popular ones is the viridis() package. To use it just load viridis and add a viridis color scheme to the plot. You have the option of choosing continuous, discrete or binned color schemes but here we use the discrete option scale_fill_viridis_d() because our regions constitute a discrete variable. You can also try different viridis color maps by inserting the various available schemes in the function. For example you can get the “plasma” map with `scale_fill_viridis_d(option = “plasma”). The default map is “viridis.”\n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s run our bar chart with the viridis color mapping through cvdPlot:\n\nflfp_region &lt;- flfp_region + scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty good. In fact it looks fairly close to the original. It is even to easy to see the differences in colors when looking at the desaturated output. Of course the first column for the black and white plot is difficult to distinguish from the plot’s background, but we will learn how to change this up later in this module.\nUse ColorBrewer\nAnother package available to us is the RColorBrewer package. Technically, RColorBrewer is a separate package but its color mappings come available as part of ggplot2, so we don’t have to load RColorBrewer in order to use it with ggplot2. We can also use the color brewer palette selector tool to help select palettes that are “colorblind safe.”\nLet’s try updating our column chart with a ColorBrewer color scheme:\n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now lets run it through the cvdPlot() function.\n\nflfp_region &lt;- flfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\")\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling for scatter plots and line charts\nOne thing to note is that when we want to adjust the color scheme for a scatter plot or line chart, we should use “scale_color” instead of “scale_fill”, e.g. scale_color_manual(), scale_color_viridis_d(), scale_color_brewer. Let’s try a couple of examples. First, let’s add a viridis color map to a scatter plot. We will use the flfp_gdp data we prepped in the prework section to generate our scatter plot.\n\nwealth_flfp &lt;- ggplot(flfp_gdp, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = flfp)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + # color points by region\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", linewidth = 1) +  # make the line a loess curve\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_dollar()) + # stretch axis, add '$' format\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) + # add % label\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", # x-axis title\n    y = \"Female Labor Force Participation\", # y-axis title\n    title = \"Wealth and female labor force participation\", # plot title\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\", # caption\n    color = \"Region\" # legend title\n    )\n\nwealth_flfp + scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s try adding a ColorBrewer scheme to a line chart. Here we will use the flfp_ts data frame that we prepped in our prework routine.\n\nflfp_line &lt;- ggplot(flfp_ts, aes(x = year, y = flfp, color = region)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Female Labor Force Participation\", \n    title = \"Regional trends in female labor force participation\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\"\n  )\n\nflfp_line + scale_color_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\")"

Here is a list of themes that are available with ggplot2.\nThere are also many extension packages that you can use to apply even more themes, some of which we may encounter later in the course.\nFor now, let’s take a couple of plots that we developed earlier in the lesson and apply some ggplot2 themes to them. We can do this by simply adding the name of the theme to our code.\n\nwealth_flfp + scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") + theme_dark()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\") + theme_minimal()"

    "title": "Module 2.2",
    "section": "Annotations",
    "text": "Annotations\n\nSometimes it makes sense to include annotations in our charts. We can achieve this by applying the annotate() function. To add a text annotation, we include “text” for the first argument, then the value of x and y at which we want our annotation to appear, and finally the text of the annotation that we want to display. Let’s try adding text to our indicating where high-, middle- and low-income countries are concentraed on the wealth_flfp scatter plot that we developed earlier.\n\nwealth_flfp &lt;- wealth_flfp + scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") + theme_minimal()\n\nwealth_flfp + annotate(\"text\", x = 90000, y = 75, label = \"Wealthy\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1000, y = 80, label = \"Low income\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10000, y = 20, label = \"Middle income\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother common annotation involves combining text with a horizontal or vertical reference line. For a horizontal intercept line we include an additional geom called geom_hline. The first argument is the value yintercept where we want the reference line to cross. Then we can add additional arguments to define the style, color and size of the line.\n\nflfp_line &lt;- flfp_line + scale_color_viridis_d() \n\nflfp_line + geom_hline(yintercept=52, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1995, y = 55, label = \"Global average\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same logic applies for a vertical reference line, except this time the geom is called geom_vline and the first argument, xintercept, is the point at which we want the line to cross the x-axis.\n\nflfp_line &lt;- flfp_line + scale_color_viridis_d() \n\nflfp_line + geom_vline(xintercept=2020, linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2017, y = 35, label = \"Pandemic\")"

    "title": "Module 2.2",
    "section": "Interactivity",
    "text": "Interactivity\n\nOne final thing we can do, which is really fun, is to add interactivity to our plots with plotly. We can do this by simply calling ggplotly() on our plot object.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nggplotly(flfp_line)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, we may want to control the tool tip of the plot. The tool tip is what appears when the user hovers over information on the chart. In this next example, the chart does not look that great unless we add the tooltip argument. But it is fairly simple to do. We just add the elements that we want to appear in a combine function, e.g. c(). In this case we will include region and female labor force participation in the tool tip.\n\nflfp_region &lt;- flfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\") + theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(flfp_region, tooltip = c(\"region\", \"flfp\")) # controlling the tooltip output\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing we may want to do is to include some additional annotations. We might also notice that some of the things we include in the labs argument in ggplot2 do not get picked up by plotly and that we have to add them back with a layout(annotations = ) call. One additional idiosyncrasy is that any item that we want to include in the plotly chart has to be passed as an argument in the ggplot code. For example, we need to include aes(label = country) to view country in tool tip. But plotly does support the R native pipe operator and that makes it a little easier to layer on multiple annotations.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nwealth_flfp_plotly &lt;- wealth_flfp  + \n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  aes(label = country)  # need so ggplot retains label for plotly\n\nggplotly(wealth_flfp_plotly, tooltip = c(\"country\", \"flfp\", \"gdp_pc\")) |&gt; \n  \n  layout(annotations = list(text = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\",  \n                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,\n                            xref = 'paper', x = 1.1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,\n                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) |&gt; \n  # add web address\n  layout(annotations = list(text = \"www.dataviz-gwu.rocks\", \n                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,\n                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,\n                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that plotly has some fairly unique syntax for the layout() function. It helps to read the documentation but also to search around on google and Stack Overflow. Each annotation needs to be inputted in a list format. The first time in the list is the text you want to include in the annotation. From there you can include multiple arguments to specify the font size and location of the annotation."

    "text": "Demonstrating Academic Integrity\nAll of us in the course will comply with the GW Code of Academic Integrity. It states that “we, the Students, Faculty, Librarians, Staff, and Administration of The George Washington University, believing academic integrity to be central to the mission of the University, commit ourselves to promoting high standards for the integrity of academic work. Commitment to academic integrity upholds educational equity, development, and dissemination of meaningful knowledge, and mutual respect that our community values and nurtures. The George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity is established to further this commitment.”\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one’s own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For details and complete code, see the Code of Academic Integrity.Common examples of academic dishonesty include cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, falsification, forgery of University academic documents, and facilitating academic dishonesty by others. Learn more about avoiding these:\n\nGW guidance for students on academic integrity.\nPlagiarism: What is it and how to avoid it from GW Libraries.\nMaintaining academic honesty can be a challenging skill to learn. If you have questions about maintaining our course standards, please talk with me early on.",

If you don’t have a documented disability but feel that you would benefit from learning support for other reasons, please don’t hesitate to talk to me. If you have substantial non-academic obligations or other concerns (e.g., food insecurity, work, childcare, athletic commitments, language barriers, financial issues, technology access, commuting, etc.) that make learning difficult, please contact me. I’ll keep this information confidential, and together, we can brainstorm ways to meet your needs.\n\n\nOther Needs\nAny student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact GW’s Office of Student Financial Assistance for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable doing so.

The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

If we can build good prediction models for early warning systems, then steps can be taken to reduce violence or its harmful impacts.\nIn this project, you will build and assess a violence prediction model using data about local incidents of violence in Liberia. The study was originally conducted by Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2017) and was published in the Journal of Peace Research.\nBased on your results, you will write a policy memo for the Liberian government, with an emphasis on data-driven policy recommendations.",

Please refer to the paper for details about how the data were collected. Each unit in the data is a village.\nThe main outcome variable is anyConflict, which takes a value of 1 if any type of violence occurred in the community, and 0 if not. The outcome measures captures whether any of three different violent events occurred: collective violence, interpersonal violence, or extrajudicial violence. See paper for details.\nThe dataset includes 56 possible predictors of violence. The variable names and their descriptions are below in Section 4 . All of these predictors are standardized (the mean is 0 and one unit is equivalent to a standard deviation shift), which means they are on a scale where they can be compared.\nPlease read the paper for a description of the different kinds of predictors.",

Examine descriptive information about the anyConflict variable and some of the predictors that seem interesting to you.\nTrain and assess the performance of a prediction model using logistic regression (one of the models used in the Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2017) paper). Your first step will be to replicate the model used in Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2017), which includes all of the predictors in the dataset (with no interactions).\n\nGo through each of the steps we have discussed.\nPresent evidence about the performance of the model.\nExamine the variables from the model that seem most predictive of violence (or lack thereof). Do any findings stand out? Examine the variables that seem to have no predictive value. Are there any interesting or surprising findings?\nCreate a figure (or a few figures) that help people to visualize the model results and the relative importance of different predictors.\n\nNext, develop an alternative to the Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2017) model. You could take a number of different approaches. For example, you might examine whether creating some interactions between some of the variables would improve performance. Or, you might examine whether a more simple model – which might mean data are easier/cheaper to collect – would perform equally well.\n\nTrain the new model, assess its performance, and compare to the Blair, Blattman, and Hartman (2017) model.\n\nFinally, imagine that the Liberian Government has asked you to advise them about predicting and preventing local violence in the country. Write a policy memo that summarizes your analyses and results (including data viz outputs), and which develops a set of data-driven policy recommendations that are suggested by your analyses.",

    "text": "Overview\nCommunity Driven Development (CDD) programs have become increasingly popular in international development over the past several decades. CDD programs directly involve impacted communities in the selection, design, and implementation of development projects. Usually, this also involves building upon or creating community level organizations (or committees) that are involved with the projects, with the goal of creating democratic and inclusive decision-making processes. See this 3ie working paper for discussion of some common features of CDD.\nGiven these design features, proponents of CDD argue that these programs should (a) improve the quality and impact of development projects (e.g., public goods) AND (b) improve social cohesion, inclusion, and local governance. For this reason, CDD has been implemented in a number of post-conflict settings, where the hope is that CDD can both improve development outcomes and contribute to rebuilding social cohesion and governance (which are often harmed by conflict).\nDoes CDD improve development outcomes? Does it improve social cohesion after conflict? Your goal in this assignment is to write a policy brief that answers these questions, using data from an evaluation of a CDD program in post-conflict Sierra Leone.",

    "section": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone",
    "text": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone\nSierra Leone was devastated by a civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002. In the post-conflict context, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development implemented the GoBifo (“forge ahead”) CDD project in Sierra Leone from 2005-2009 (with support from the World Bank and other international donors). See this report for a detailed summary of the program.\nThe program had two key components:\n\nBlock grants of about 4,667 dollars (about 100 per household in each community) that communities could allocate to local development projects, skills trainings, and small-business investment.\n“Technical assistance that promoted democratic decision-making, the participation of socially marginalized women and youth in local politics, and transparent budgeting practices” (Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel 2012)\n\nThe GiBifo program also included an impact evaluation, conducted by economists Katherine Casey, Rachel Glennerster, and Edward Miguel. The academic paper generated from the project is in the References section (Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel 2012).\nWait until after you complete your assignment to read the full paper.\nImportantly, the impact evaluation included randomization: communities in the study were randomly assigned to receive the GoBifo program, or not. In this sense, the impact evaluation was similar to a clinical drug trial, where some subjects are randomly assigned to receive the medicine while others do not receive it. This aspect of the design makes it easier to assess the causal impact of this project: we can simply compare outcomes in the treatment (GoBifo program) and control groups, and test for whether any differences we observe are likely to be due to chance.",

The study team gathered literally hundreds of outcome variables, and the paper includes an interesting discussion of how they analyze the data and interpret the results given the large number of outcomes they measured.\nFor our purposes, we will focus on a smaller set of variables, summarized below:\n\nTreatment variable (named t in the data): this equals 1 if the community was randomly assigned to be in the program, and 0 if not.\nCommunity Decision Making Infrastructure: Is there a village development committee in the community? (vdc)\nPublic Goods\n\nIs there a functioning latrine in the community? (f_latrine)\nIs there a functioning primary school in the community? (f_psch)\n\nInclusion, Gender equality in participatory decision making (role_wmn).\n\n[“Enumerator account of how actively women participated in the deliberation compared to men, ranging from 5 = no difference between women and men to 1 = women not active at all compared to men (field activity #1)”]\n\nSocial Capital\n\nTrust in other in the community (trust_own)\nConflict, coded as percentage of respondents in the village that reported they had NO conflicts/disputes with others that required outside intervention (no_conflict)",

Use this document to explore the data, work on putting together the code for your analysis, and to take notes as you go.\nExamine the data. How many units (villages) are there in the study? How many were in the treatment (t) group (in the program) and how many were in control? Examine the different outcome measures, calcuate some summary statistics (e.g., the mean), and make some graphs.\nFor each outcome variable listed above, generate an estimate of the mean AND generate a 95 percent confidence interval, separately in treatment and control (where t==0 and t==1). Create a visualization (or multiple) that presents these means and 95 percent confidence intervals: the visualization should allow us to visibly examine the difference between treatment and control groups on these outcome measures.\nFor each outcome, conduct hypothesis tests that assess whether the GoBifo program had an impact. Clearly state the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for each test.\nWrite a policy brief that (1) provides a very short background on the program and Sierra Leone case, (2) presents your results (including graphs), (3) accurately interprets the results, and (4) discusses the policy/program implications of the findings for CDD in post-conflict settings.\n\nCreate a new Quarto document for your policy brief, which includes your write-up and any code needed to produce the final figures/tables in your memo.

    "section": "Reshaping data",
    "text": "Reshaping data\n\nThere are a few things about the data here that make it messy. First, in order for the data to be tidy, we want each column to represent a variable and each row to represent an observation.\nBut here we see the reverse: the data are in wide form, meaning that each column represents a year and each row represents a country. This entails that each row represents multiple observations in that we have data for multiple years for each row.\nTo rectify this, we need to reshape the data from wide form to long form. For this, we need the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package.\nThe pivot_longer() function takes three basic arguments:\n\n\ncols - which columns you want to pivot\n\nnames_to - the name of the column where the old column names are going to\n\nvalues_to - the name of the column where the values are going to\n\nIn our case, we want to reshape all of the year columns and have the years represented in the rows. We want the newly created column to be called “year” and the values are going to represent the data on female labor force participation we downloaded (flfp).\n\n# Load tidyr\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Reshape the data\nwb_data &lt;- wb_data_messy |&gt; # take wb_data_messy, and put it in wb_data, but first...\n  pivot_longer(             # pivot the data from wide to long form\n    cols = `1972 [YR1972]`: `2021 [YR2021]`, # columns to pivot\n    names_to = \"year\", # name the first column \"year\"\n    values_to = \"flfp\" # name the second column \"flfp\"\n  ) \n\n# View the data\nglimpse(wb_data)\n\nRows: 11,100\nColumns: 6\n$ `Country Name` &lt;chr&gt; \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanist…\n$ `Country Code` &lt;chr&gt; \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\",…\n$ `Series Name`  &lt;chr&gt; \"Labor force participation rate, female (% of female po…\n$ `Series Code`  &lt;chr&gt; \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.…\n$ year           &lt;chr&gt; \"1972 [YR1972]\", \"1973 [YR1973]\", \"1974 [YR1974]\", \"197…\n$ flfp           &lt;chr&gt; \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pipe Operator\n\n\n\nFor our pivot-longer() call we used R’s native pipe operator, e.g. |&gt;. Pipes tell R to do something to the object that they are attached to. In this case, we are telling R to apply pivot_longer() to wb_data. The alternative way of writing this code would be to include the data as the first argument in the function, e.g. pivot_longer(wb_data, cols = ..., names_to = ... , values_to = ...). As you will see, pipe operators enable us to string together multiple functions in a convenient way to transform our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces in Variable Names\n\n\n\nNotice that when we specify the years in our pivot_longer() call we encapsulate them in backticks (``). This is because the years, as they were imported from the WDI dataset, have spaces in them. Typically we want to avoid this scenario by writing our variable names in snake_case."

The “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics.” The grammar of graphics is a layered approach to constructing graphs based on a book by Leland Wilkinson.\nThe idea is that each visualization you make is going to contain cerain elements. You will start with some data. Then you will incorporate some “aesthetics” which you can think of as the dimensions of the visualization (x-axis, y-axis and color, size or shapes for additional dimensions). Next you identify a geometric obejct that you want to use such as a bar, a line or a point. From there you can customize various elements of the plot like the title and axis scales and labels."

Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading in the dem_summary.csv file that you can find here. Next we will do our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

Let’s go ahead and add the fct_reorder() from the forcats package to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nlibrary(forcats)\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = fct_reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nFirst, let’s grab the relevant data using vdemdata and dplyr. We are going to be downloading the polyarchy measure for the U.S., Japan and Portugal as far back as the data are available. So first we will select country name, year and the polyarchy schore and then we will filter the data based on the three country names. We are saving these data in an object called dem_waves_ctrs.\n\nlibrary(vdemdata)\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- vdem |&gt;\n  select(\n    country = country_name,     \n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n  ) |&gt;\n  filter( \n    country %in% c(\"United States of America\", # select countries in this list\n                   \"Japan\", \n                   \"Portugal\")\n    )\n\nwrite_csv(dem_waves_ctrs, \"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. The data will be the dem_waves_ctrs object that we just created. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to `1’ so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Country” with a capital “C.”\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )"

    "text": "Scatter plots\n\nThe last thing we are going to do in this lesson is to create a scatter plot. We use scatter plots in order to illustrate how two variables relate to each other (or not). In this example, we are going to illustrating modernization theory, which predicts a positive relationship between wealth and democracy, while also incorporating levels of women’s representation into our analysis.\nWe are going to start with the dem_women.csv file we created in Module 1.2. We will then group the data by country and calculate the mean for each variable. Note that in the group_by() call we also include region because we will want to keep it so that we can color our points by region.\n\ndem_summary_ctry &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_women.csv\") |&gt;\n  group_by(country, region) |&gt; # group by country, keep region\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), \n    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), \n    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow let’s create our first scatter plot. Our ggplot() call looks similar to previous ones except for a few things. First we are calling geom_point() for our geom. But also notice that our aesthetics mapping includes four dimenstions: x, y, color and size. So here we are telling ggplot2 that we want wealth on the x-axis, the polyarchy score on the y-axis, to color the points based on region, and to vary the size of the points in relation to the level of women’s representation.\nOne last thing we want to do is to put our x-axis on a log scale and change the labels to reflect their dollar values. For the log scale, we can use the scale_x_log10() function and for the labels we can use the label_number() function from the scales package. We set the prefix to “$” and the suffix to “k” so that each number on the x-axis starts with a dollar sign and ends with “k” denoting “thousands.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will encounter other useful scales functions including label_dollar() and label_percent() in future lessons.\nNotice that in this example we introduce the scales package by including it as a prefix to the label_number() function, e.g. scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\"). This allows us to use the package without having to load it, e.g. library(scales). It also has the benefit of generating a list of auto-complete suggestions for the many available functions in the scales package.\n\n\n\n# in this ggplot() call we have four dimensions\n# x, y, color, and size\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy, color = region, size = women_rep)) + \n  geom_point() + # use geom_point() for scatter plots\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\",\n    size = \"Women Reps\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot does a good job of illustrating the basic point of modernization theory in that we do see the positive correlation between wealth and democracy. But we also see that there are some outliers and that a lot of the outlier countries are concentrated in the Middle East.\nWe also see that the distribution of women’s representation is somewhat orthogonal to wealth and democracy. Most wealthy western countries have high levels of women’s representation, but so do a lot of low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nAdding a trend line\nWe can definitely see a relationship between wealth and democracy in the scatter plot, but how strong is it? One way to find out is to add a trend line. Let’s do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth(), and specifying a linear model with the argument method = \"lm\" We acn also set the linewidth of the trend line to 1 so that the line is more visible.\nIf we want to add a single trend while also maintaining the coloring by region, then we have to reconfigure the ggplot() call a bit. Specifically, we will want to move color = region to a separate aes() call in the geom_point() function, e.g. geom_point(aes(color = region)). If we don’t do this we will get separate trend lines for each region (try it and see!).\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\nLabeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )"

This can be true when we have a small number of cases that we want to discuss.\nIn this module we are going to be working with the tidycensus package to download income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the kableExtra and gt packages to visualize it. Along the way, we discuss “the grammar of tables” and some situations where a table would be less appropriate than other methods of visualizing our data."

To use tidycensus you need a Census API key, which you can get here.\n\nlibrary(tidycensus)\ncensus_api_key(\"YOUR API KEY\") # enter your census api key here in quotes\n\nUse the load_variables() function to import data from the census or ACS for a particular year. There is a cache = TRUE option if you want to cache the data for faster retrieval in the future.

From there we use get_acs() to retrieve the data based on the codes for the five quintiles and the top five percent of earners.\nIn our call, we specify “state” as the geography and “2021” as the year. This will ensure that data from the 2017-2021 ACS is retrieved. Note that by default, tidycensus returns data such that rows represent a unit-variable combination. To get the data with census variables in the columns, we have to specify wide form with output = \"wide\". We will select all of the variables except for the margin of error and GEOID. Let’s rename NAME so it is in lower case. And for some reason, tidycensus puts an “E” suffix at the end of all of our variables when we specify wide format, so let’s use rename_with() and str_remove from the [stringr] package to get rid of that suffix.

A choropleth map is a type of data visualization used to show a geographical distribution of data where areas or regions are shaded based on quantities or levels represented in each area or region.\nOne important concept in mapping that we are going to come across this week: simple features. Simple features is a formal international standard for representing objects in the real world in digital space.\nA “feature” is basically any object in the real world that can be represented in two or three-dimensional space. A tree or a house can be a feature as can a forest or a body of water. But in politics we are usually focused on mapping the political boundaries of different administrative units like countries, states or provinces, counties and cities.\nSimple features allow us to work with such boundaries easily in a data frame in R. We can take all of the points associated with a geometry and store it in a special data frame column (usually labeled ‘geom’ or ‘geometry’). This ability to store all of the geographic information in one column differs from how spatial data are organized under the traditional spatial objects standard and makes it much easier to work with geographic data in R."

It is going to include five arguments: var_id, title, legend_title, theme and direction. var_id refers to the World Bank variable id, title and legend_title refer to the title of the plot and the title of the legend respectively. theme will allow the user to adjust the viridis theme. And direction refers to whether the color scale is light to dark or dark to light.\nThe code block will first join the country shapes to the selected World Bank data and then map those data by piping them into a ggplot() call. Everything is pretty similar to our previous use of ggplot() and geom_sf(), but one tricky part here is that we have to use eval(parse(text=var_id)))) to remove the quotes surrounding the variable code entered by the user.\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(wbstats)\n\ncreate_map &lt;- function(var_id, title, legend_title, theme, direction){\n\nne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\") |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    wb_data(var_id, mrnev = 1), # change variable id\n    join_by(iso_a3 == iso3c)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(name != \"Antarctica\") |&gt;  \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(aes(fill = eval(parse(text=var_id)))) + # remove quotes\n  labs(\n    title =  title, # change title\n    fill = legend_title, # change legend title\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\"\n    ) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c( \n    option = \"magma\", #  chg theme\n    direction = direction # change direction of scale\n    )\n}\n\nDeploy the function in another document\nTo deploy the function in a Quarto or R Markdown dackument, we need to source it as an external R script. First we will save the previous code as a source document. Let’s name our file wb-maps.R and save it in a subdirectory called functions. From there, we can use the source() function so that we can call our create_map() function in subsequent code chunks in our document.\n\nsource(\"functions/wb-maps.R\", local = knitr::knit_global())\n\nNow let’s call our create_map() function that we just made using female labor force particpation.\n\ncreate_map(var_id = \"SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\", \n           title= \"Female Labor Force Participation\", \n           legend_title = \"FLFP %\", \n           theme = \"inferno\", \n           direction = -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow search for an indicator we want to use. We will look for something related to GDP per capita.\n\nwb_search(\"GDP per capita\") \n\n# A tibble: 24 × 3\n   indicator_id       indicator                                   indicator_desc\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;chr&gt;         \n 1 5.51.01.10.gdp     Per capita GDP growth                       GDP per capit…\n 2 6.0.GDPpc_constant GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 interna… GDP per capit…\n 3 NV.AGR.PCAP.KD.ZG  Real agricultural GDP per capita growth ra… The growth ra…\n 4 NY.GDP.PCAP.CD     GDP per capita (current US$)                GDP per capit…\n 5 NY.GDP.PCAP.CN     GDP per capita (current LCU)                GDP per capit…\n 6 NY.GDP.PCAP.KD     GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$)          GDP per capit…\n 7 NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG  GDP per capita growth (annual %)            Annual percen…\n 8 NY.GDP.PCAP.KN     GDP per capita (constant LCU)               GDP per capit…\n 9 NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD  GDP per capita, PPP (current international… This indicato…\n10 NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD  GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 interna… GDP per capit…\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nNow let’s take that info. and use it to make a plot of GDP per capita.\n\ncreate_map(var_id = \"NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD\", \n           title= \"GDP per capita (constant 2017 internatioal $)\", \n           legend_title = \"Geary-Khamis $\", \n           theme = \"mako\", \n           direction = -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you go! That’s how we can build and use a map function to easily map different indicators in our document or web app."

So while we will be building on some of our earlier knowledge, this module is going to depart a bit from previous ones in that we are using an entirely new dataset. Specifically, we will be using the UCDP georeferenced event dataset, which you can download from here.\nAfter you have downloaded the data and saved it in your modules folder, go ahead and, read it in and have a look at its contents with glimpse().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am working with a truncated version of the UCDP GED data so that I can upload everything to GitHub. Consequently, my glimpse() output may look slightly different from yours if you are using the full data.\n\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nged_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GEDEvent_v22_1.csv\")\n\nglimpse(ged_data)\n\nOne thing we have to manage right away is the specific country codes used in these data. There is a whole art to managing international standards organization (ISO) codes which we have already touched on in our discussion of the countrycodes package. For the pruposes of this course, it is enough to be aware of the fact that country-level data sets use different coding systems and that this poses a small hurdle to the visualization and analysis of country-level data.\nFor this analysis, we are going to want to filter by country and specifically we want conflict data for Yemen. According to the UCDP codebook, this dataset uses Gleditsch-Ward (GW) country identifiers. One option could be to simply look up the GW country code for Yemen. But there is also a nice package developed called states. It has a function called sfind() that we can use to find the relevant country code.\n\nlibrary(states)\n\nsfind(\"Yemen\")[1:6]\n\nHere we see that the GW code for Yemen is 678. Although there are many listings for Yemen, we know that it is the right code because the Arab Republic of Yemen (our other option for a GW Yemen code) ceased to exist in 1990 following its unification with the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen.\nLet’s go ahead and use our newly discovered country code to wrangle some data for Yemen. We will filter for Yemen’s country ID and events from 2021 and, to keep things manageable, we will only include events that started before March 1 2021.\nLooking again at the codebook, we see there are codings for how certain the coders were regarding where an event occurred and that they also coded for the quality of the reporting. We will keep events with a location precision score less than 3 and an event clarity score equal to 1.\nFrom there we will create a new variable deaths that sums the different categories of deaths (side a, side b, civilian and unknown). Then we will select all of these variables and the location coordinates and use the st_as_sf() function from the sf package to conver the coordinates into simple features objects.\n\nged_yemen &lt;- ged_data |&gt; \n  filter(\n    country_id == 678, #gw country code\n    year == 2021,\n    date_start &lt; \"2021-03-01\", \n    where_prec &lt; 3, # keep if certain where event occurred\n    event_clarity == 1, # keep if event reporting is clear\n      ) |&gt; \n  mutate(deaths = deaths_a + deaths_b + deaths_civilians + deaths_unknown) |&gt;\n  select(event_id = id,\n         country_id,\n         date = date_start,\n         gov_deaths = deaths_a, \n         rebel_deaths = deaths_b, \n         civilian_deaths = deaths_civilians, \n         deaths, \n         place = where_coordinates,\n         latitude, \n         longitude) |&gt;\n  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\")) \n\nglimpse(ged_yemen)"

    "text": "Make a leaflet map\n\nNow that we have our data, let’s make our first pop-up map. To do this we are going to be using the leaflet package. Leaflet is a really popular JavaScript library for interactive maps. To get started with leaflet, we’ll make a really simple map with one marker that says “First conflict event.”\nPlot a single marker\nLet’s start with a really simple hypothetical example. Let’s say we want to plot one conflict event that we have the coordinates for and label it “First conflict event.” To do this, we would first call the leaflet()function. From there will add default street map tiles with addTiles() and then our single pop-up marker with addMarkers().\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nleaflet() |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng = 45.46916, lat = 14.14912, label = \"First conflict event\")\n\nPlot some conflict events from Yemen\nNow that you have the hang of it, we can move on to plotting some conflict events from our data frame. Again we will call leaflet() but this time we will add data = ged_yemen as an argument. We will also use setView() to center the map on Yemen’s capital Sana’a. We include two arguments for addMarkers. popup = ~as.character(deaths) displays the number of deaths when the user clicks on the marker and label = ~place displays the name of the town that the coordinates correspond to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that arguments for the popup = argument take the form of a one-sided formula, meaning that they require a tilde (~) as a prefix. Scroll to the bottom of this page for a more detailed explanation of the ~ notation in this context.\n\n\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |&gt; # map points in ged_yemen data frame\n  addTiles() |&gt; # add default tile\n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |&gt; # Sana'a coordinates\n  addMarkers(\n    popup = ~as.character(deaths), # when user clicks, show deaths\n    label = ~place # when user hovers, show town\n    )"

    "text": "Customize your leaflet map\n\nNext, let’s do some customization to make our map look amazing. We will talk about changing the icon style, customized the information displayed in the icon and adding base maps.\nUse an awesome icon\nWe can dress our leaflet map up a little bit with the addAwesomeMarkers() function which allows us to use the glyphicons, font awesome and ionicons libraries.\nFirst we will use awesomeIcons() to store the icon we want to use. Here we choose “ios-close” from the ionic library. We will say that we want the icon colorto be black and the surrounding marker color to be red. Then we call addAwesomeMarkers() and specify icon = icon to call the red and black ionic marker.\n\n# save icon\nicon &lt;- awesomeIcons(\n  icon = \"ios-close\",\n  iconColor = \"black\",\n  markerColor = \"red\", \n  library = \"ion\" \n)\n\n# Build map\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |&gt;   \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |&gt; # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~as.character(deaths), \n    label = ~place\n    )\n\nChange content of the popup\nLet’s say we want to add more information to our pop-up when the user clicks on it. Instead of just showing the total number of deaths, we also want to show the date of the event and the breakdown of government deaths, rebel deaths and civilian deaths.\nThe easiest way to do this is going to be to add a column to our data frame with a label associated with each event. We will use the base R sprintf() function combined with htmltools to create these labels. sprintf() returns a formatted string using values in a list. The first parameter in sprintf is the format and the second is the values that go into the format.\nIn this example, we are separating the lines of our label with html () and we are passing in a string (%s) for the date and numeric values (%.0f) for the number of deaths.\nThen we call HMTL from htmltools and use lapply() to apply the function to every line in the data frame.\n\nged_yemen$popup_text &lt;- sprintf(\n      \"Date: %s &lt;br&gt; \n       Total Deaths: %.0f &lt;br&gt; \n       Govt. Deaths: %.0f &lt;br&gt; \n       Rebel Deaths: %.0f &lt;br&gt; \n       Civilian Death: %.0f &lt;br&gt;\",\n      ged_yemen$date, \n      ged_yemen$deaths, \n      ged_yemen$gov_deaths, \n      ged_yemen$rebel_deaths,\n      ged_yemen$civilian_deaths\n    ) |&gt; lapply(htmltools::HTML)\n\nNow we can use the new labels to enhance the markers by specifying popup = ~popup_text in the addAwesomeMarkers() function.\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |&gt;  \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |&gt; # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~popup_text, \n    label = ~place\n    )\n\nNow let’s spot check the labels.\n\nged_yemen |&gt;\n  filter(place == \"Marib Dam\")\n\nUsing basemaps\nAs a last step, let’s change the basemap. We can do this by specifying addProviderTiles() instead of addTiles() and specifying the basemap that we want to use. Here is a list of available basemaps. For this example, we are going to use “OpenTopoMap.”\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |&gt; # Jan and Feb  \n  addProviderTiles(\"OpenTopoMap\") |&gt; # include name of provider here\n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |&gt; # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~popup_text, \n    label = ~place\n    )\n\nNow we can see a bit more about the topography, which could be super-useful for conflict analysis."

It is available as an open-source package in R that is maintained by the team at Posit.\nShiny enables you to create interactive web-based visualizations and dashboards directly from your R code. It simplifies the process of developing web applications by providing a higher-level abstraction and handling the underlying web technologies. With Shiny, you can allow your users to explore data, change parameters, and see the results of an analysis dynamically without needing extensive web development skills.\nTo display a Shiny app you can just render it locally, but you likely want to share it with a broader audience. For this, you will need to host it on a server. There are lots of different to do this, but the easiest thing to use when you are getting started is shinyapps.io. In a later module we will learn to deploy our apps, but for this one it is fine to just view them locally.\nShiny apps consist of three components:1) a user interface (UI); 2) a server function; and 3) a call to the Shiny app. The UI is the part of the app that defines what the user is going to see and interact with. The server function runs all of the computations and produces the visualizations and output that you want to display. And the call to the Shiny app simply tells Shiny to run the app.\nWe are going to talk about each of these elements in turn, but first, have a look at this scatter plot app that we are going to but first take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with this scatter plot app that we are going to building in this this module:"

    "text": "Setup\n\nI said earlier that there are three main components of a Shiny app (UI, server and call to app). However, with most apps, there is usually a bit of setup int the code before you get to this point. So perhaps you could say there are actually four elements of a Shiny app, with the set up being the “0th” element.\nThere are going to be two components to the setup for this app. First we are going to “pre-wrangle” our data and store it in a .csv file. I will explain why in a minute. Second, we are going to build a setup code chunk that we will include in our app.R file. Let’s get started.\nWrangling and storing the data\nFor this app, we want users to be able to create scatter plots using selected variables from the V-Dem dataset. Let’s say that we want to have a nice mix of variables related to democracy and development so that users can explore how democracy relates to development and vice versa. So we will filter the data for the post-2000 period and select measures relating to democracy, governance and women’s empowerment and then four measures related to development.\nWe will also make sure to code a region variable and include region in the group_by() call so that it stays in the data frame. Then we will take the country mean of the measures for the post-2000 period so that we have one set of observations for each each country.\nFinally, let’s then save these data in a .csv file to include with the app. Alternatively, we could have our app wrangle the data each time the app is loaded. This would ensure that the data are always up to date, but it would require more resources than is available with the free version of the Shiny server due to the size of the V-Dem dataset.\n\nlibrary(vdemdata)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndem_data &lt;- vdem |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 2000) |&gt;\n  select(\n    country = country_name, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy,\n    clientelism = v2xnp_client,\n    corruption = v2xnp_regcorr,\n    womens_emp = v2x_gender,\n    gdp_pc = e_gdppc,\n    inf_mort = e_peinfmor,\n    life_exp = e_pelifeex,\n    education = e_peaveduc,\n    region = e_regionpol_6C \n  ) |&gt;   mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, \n                        1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                        2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                        3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                        4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                        5 ~ \"The West\", \n                        6 ~ \"Asia\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(country, region) |&gt;\n  summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#glimpse(dem_data)\n\nwrite_csv(dem_data, \"dem_data.csv\")\n\nSetup code chunk\nNow let’s build a setup code chunk that we can include in the app.R script. Here we will load the packages we need for the app and read in the data we just wrangled from the .csv file. Finally, let’s go ahead and create a list of variable names for our dropdown menus in the app and map these to the variables in our data frame.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# load the data \ndem_data &lt;- read_csv(\"dem_data.csv\")\n\n# create list of named values for the input selection\nvars &lt;- c(\"Democracy\" = \"polyarchy\",\n          \"Clientelism\" = \"clientelism\",\n          \"Corruption\" = \"corruption\",\n          \"Women's Empowerment\" = \"womens_emp\",\n          \"Wealth\" = \"gdp_pc\",\n          \"Infant Mortality\" = \"inf_mort\",\n          \"Life Expectancy\" = \"life_exp\", \n          \"Education\" = \"education\")"

    "text": "UI\n\nThe user interface (UI) defines the layout and appearance of the web application. Here you tell Shiny what elements such as buttons, sliders, text inputs, plots, and other interactive components that you want users to be able to interact with.\nWe will start with the fluidPage() function as the outermost layer of our UI and then add additional container functions within it. First we will add a titlePanel(). You are free to call this app whatever you like but I thought a good title would be “Democracy and Development.”\nThen we can add a sidebar panel with dropdown menus to select the variables to display in the scatter plot. For this we call sidebarLayout() and then within that sidebarPanel(). This next step is really important. We are going to use the list variables called vars from our setup code chunk to populate the dropdown menus. To do this we are going to call selectInput() twice–once for the x-axis variable that the user wants to appear on the scatter plot and once for the y-axis variable.\nThe three main arguments for this function are input, label and choices. input is the input ID that we will use to access the user selection later on in the server function. label refers to the name that we want to appear above the dropdown menu. And choices refers to the list of choices to appear in the dropdown (in our case the list of variables called vars.)\nWe can also include the argument selected in our selectInput() call to determine which variable is selected by default when the app loads. We are going to specify the sixth variable in the list for the y-axis (vars[[6]]) to make sure that the same two variables do not appear on both the x and y axes.\nThe final piece of our UI is the main panel where we want our scatter plot to appear. Let’s go ahead and add mainPanel() and then within that call plotOutput(\"scatterplot\"). This is going to dynamically retrieve the updated scatter plot as the user changes the variables in the dropdown menu.\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a scatter plot\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Democracy and Development\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a two dropdown menus\n    sidebarLayout(\n      sidebarPanel(\n        selectInput(input = 'xcol', label = 'X Variable', choices = vars),\n        selectInput(input = 'ycol', label = 'Y Variable', \n                    choices = vars, selected = vars[[6]])\n      ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"scatterplot\")\n        )\n    )\n)"

The server function receives input from the user interface, processes it, and generates the corresponding output. It can perform calculations, query databases, apply statistical models, and produce visualizations.\nThe server function contains three arguments. Two of them (input and output) are mandatory. session is an optional parameter that controls the behavior of the app during the user session that we won’t get into here. But we will keep it in the function call for now just to remind us that it is there.\nNext we are going to define the output of the app with output$scatterplot &lt;- renderPlot({}). This bit of code is going to render a plot and then save it to the output in an object called scatterplot. Remember that in the UI, we defined our plot output as plotOutput(\"scatterplot\"). This is where that object scatterplot is going to come from. The scatter plot is going to be created in two steps. First we are going to reactively retrieve the data each time the user selects new inputs. To do this we are going to use the inputs (xcol, ycol) from the UI to subset our data frame demdata, e.g. dem_data[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol, \"region\")]. That is going to create a three-column data frame with the user’s selected x variable, y variable and the region coding and store it in an object called selectedData.\nFrom there, we take selectedData and use it to create a scatter plot with ggplot2. This is done in the usual way, except for a couple of things. First, in our aes() call we need to use get() to specify the x and y variables. aes() uses nonstandard evaluation to capture variable names, meaning that the bare column names of the data frame are read directly so that you do not have to explicitly quote the inputs. However, in this case the names of the inputs are being passed as a string from the user. The get() function enables us to retrieve the value of an object based on its name. So our aes() call will be aes(x = get(x = input$xcol), y = get(input$ycol)).\nThe other thing we need to do is to add some special code to deal with the x- and y-axis labels because these are going to change every time the user selects a different variable. Here we are going to use the names() function to return the names of the the object selected in the vars vector of variable names. To make sure we get the right name from the vector, we are going to use the which() function. which() returns the value that satisfies a given function, in this case the index number of the vars vector that matches the user input. So for example, our x label will be defined as x = names(vars[which(vars == input$xcol)]. Here the number returned by [which(vars == input$xcol)] is going to be used to subset the vars list so that x displays the name of the variable selected by the user.\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a scatter plot\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # Render the plot\n  output$scatterplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    \n    # ggplot call\n    ggplot(dem_data, aes(x = get(input$xcol), y = get(input$ycol))) +\n      geom_point(aes(color = region)) +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n      scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n      theme_minimal() +\n      labs(\n        x =  names(vars[which(vars == input$xcol)]), # select names in vars that\n        y =  names(vars[which(vars == input$ycol)]), # match input selections\n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\",\n        color = \"Region\"\n      )\n  })\n}"

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nFirst, let’s grab the relevant data using vdemdata and dplyr. We are going to be downloading the polyarchy measure for the U.S., Japan and Portugal as far back as the data are available. So first we will select country name, year and the polyarchy schore and then we will filter the data based on the three country names. We are saving these data in an object called dem_waves_ctrs.\n\nlibrary(vdemdata)\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- vdem |&gt;\n  select(\n    country = country_name,     \n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n  ) |&gt;\n  filter( \n    country %in% c(\"United States of America\", # select countries in this list\n                   \"Japan\", \n                   \"Portugal\")\n    )\n\nwrite_csv(dem_waves_ctrs, \"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. The data will be the dem_waves_ctrs object that we just created. You can should have the data saved but you can also download it here. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to `1’ so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Country” with a capital “C.”\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )"

    "text": "Scatter plots\n\nThe last thing we are going to do in this lesson is to create a scatter plot. We use scatter plots in order to illustrate how two variables relate to each other (or not). In this example, we are going to illustrating modernization theory, which predicts a positive relationship between wealth and democracy, while also incorporating levels of women’s representation into our analysis.\nWe are going to start with the dem_women.csv file that you can find here. We will then group the data by country and calculate the mean for each variable. Note that in the group_by() call we also include region because we will want to keep it so that we can color our points by region.\n\ndem_summary_ctry &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_women.csv\") |&gt;\n  group_by(country, region) |&gt; # group by country, keep region\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), \n    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), \n    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow let’s create our first scatter plot. Our ggplot() call looks similar to previous ones except for a few things. First we are calling geom_point() for our geom. But also notice that our aesthetics mapping includes four dimenstions: x, y, color and size. So here we are telling ggplot2 that we want wealth on the x-axis, the polyarchy score on the y-axis, to color the points based on region, and to vary the size of the points in relation to the level of women’s representation.\nOne last thing we want to do is to put our x-axis on a log scale and change the labels to reflect their dollar values. For the log scale, we can use the scale_x_log10() function and for the labels we can use the label_number() function from the scales package. We set the prefix to “$” and the suffix to “k” so that each number on the x-axis starts with a dollar sign and ends with “k” denoting “thousands.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will encounter other useful scales functions including label_dollar() and label_percent() in future lessons.\nNotice that in this example we introduce the scales package by including it as a prefix to the label_number() function, e.g. scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\"). This allows us to use the package without having to load it, e.g. library(scales). It also has the benefit of generating a list of auto-complete suggestions for the many available functions in the scales package.\n\n\n\n# in this ggplot() call we have four dimensions\n# x, y, color, and size\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy, color = region, size = women_rep)) + \n  geom_point() + # use geom_point() for scatter plots\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\",\n    size = \"Women Reps\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot does a good job of illustrating the basic point of modernization theory in that we do see the positive correlation between wealth and democracy. But we also see that there are some outliers and that a lot of the outlier countries are concentrated in the Middle East.\nWe also see that the distribution of women’s representation is somewhat orthogonal to wealth and democracy. Most wealthy western countries have high levels of women’s representation, but so do a lot of low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nAdding a trend line\nWe can definitely see a relationship between wealth and democracy in the scatter plot, but how strong is it? One way to find out is to add a trend line. Let’s do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth(), and specifying a linear model with the argument method = \"lm\" We acn also set the linewidth of the trend line to 1 so that the line is more visible.\nIf we want to add a single trend while also maintaining the coloring by region, then we have to reconfigure the ggplot() call a bit. Specifically, we will want to move color = region to a separate aes() call in the geom_point() function, e.g. geom_point(aes(color = region)). If we don’t do this we will get separate trend lines for each region (try it and see!).\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\nLabeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )"
