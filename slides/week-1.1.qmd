## Why Take this Course?

<br>

-   International Affairs is changing!
-   Data is everywhere and it is changing the way government works
-   You will be a better consumer of data and research
-   You can be a "bridge builder" between traditional analysts and data scientists on your team

## Data Informed Dipomacy

<br>

> Data is a critical instrument of diplomacy. When our workforce has data at their fingertips they are better prepared to engage diplomatically, manage effectively, and lead globally.

| Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, 2022[^1]

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Cultivate a Data Culture
- Accelerate Decisions through Analytics
- Establish Mission-Driven Data Management
- Enhance Enterprise Data Governance
:::
:::

## Open Goverment Data Act (2018)

- Requires government data assets to be published as machine-readable data in open formats 
- Requires Chief Data Officers (CDOs) to be appointed at federal agencies
- Requires CDOs to develop and maintain comprehensive data inventories
- Has led to a proliferation of data science roles in the federal government

## Open Source Intelligence 

<br>

- More than 90% of the analysis in the intelligence community is based on open source information
- Government agencies use a lot of the same datasets that we will be using in this class
- Yet the OSINT community has only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible with data science

## 

<br>

::: notes
MLP's digital tools provide fine-grained data tracking and forecasting major political events across nearly 60 countries by continuously scraping and process tens of millions of articles published by more than 300 local, regional, and international news sources in more than 30 languages. This infrastructure provides up-to-date data on recent and historical trends in civic space and foreign influence and builds forecasting models that learn from historical patterns to predict how conditions are likely to change in the near future.

## Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

::: {.incremental}
- Another important use of data in international affairs is monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL)
- MEL is a process that helps organizations track and assess the performance of their programs
- MEL is a key component of [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/activity-monitoring-evaluation-and-learning-mel-plan), the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/research) and other agencies 
- A major component of MEL is the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) and other designs, which you will learn about in this class
:::

## Skills/Knowledge You Will Gain

<br>

::: incremental
1.  R coding skills (and RStudio), with focus on "tidy" approach and reproducible research

3.  How to access and "clean" data so that you can analyze it
4.  When you hear terms like "machine learning", you'll have some sense of what people are talking about
:::

## Course Website

<br>

-   <https://quant4ia.rocks>
-   Let's take a quick tour!

## Install R and RStudio

<br>

-   If you haven't already...
-   Go to the RStudio [download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
-   Download R and then RStudio

## Set up RStudio {.smaller}

<br>

-   Go to Tools\>Global Options
-   Under Code, enable native pipe operator (`|>`)
-   Under Appearance, choose a theme
-   Configure panes
    -   Go to Pane Layout
    -   Move Source, Console, etc. to preferred positions

## Illustration

![](images/rstudio-setup.gif){fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: timer1

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3, 
          id = "timer1", 
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%",
          color_border = "#fff",
          color_text = "#fff",
          color_running_background = "#42affa",
          color_running_text = "black",
          color_finished_background = "#E5D19D",
          color_finished_text = "#00264A")
```

## Install key packages

-   Install the Tidyverse group of packages from the console
    -   `install.packages("tidyverse")`
-   Install `devtools`
    -   `install.packages("devtools")`)
-   Install tinytex (for PDF rendering)
    -   Go to your terminal and type `quarto install tinytex`

## Illustration

![](images/install-packages.gif){fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: timer2

countdown(minutes = 3, 
          id = "timer2",
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%")
```

## Let's get going . . .

<br>

Your first data visualizations...

(and making sure we have R and RStudio installed and ready to roll)

## Example: Make a map!

```{r}
#| label: leaflet_map

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%   # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lat = 38.90243843683386, lng =  -77.0443814477152, 
             label = "Elliott School of International Affairs")
```

## Example: Plotting Democracy Over Time

```{r}
#| label: plot_democracy

# For nice colors that work for color blind
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

library(vdemdata)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
# We will use the data called vdem
vdem %>%
  # and then we are going to filter out and only use France and India
  filter(country_name == "France" | country_name == "India") %>%
  # and then we are going to only use years since 1850
  filter(year > 1849) %>% 
    # and then we are going to use this filtered data to make a plot
    #with democracy on the y axis and year on the x
    # we want this plot to use different colors for each country
    ggplot(., aes(y = v2x_polyarchy, x = year, color=country_name)) +
      geom_line() +
      theme_minimal() +
      xlab("Year") +
      ylab("Electoral Democracy Index") +
      ggtitle("Electoral Democracy, 1850-2022") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
       scale_color_manual(name="Country", values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
      ylim(0, 1)
```

## Example: UN Voting Trends

```{r}
#| label: un_voting

library(tidyverse)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(pacman)

unvotes <- un_votes %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid")

unvotes %>%
  # then filter out to only include the countries we want
  filter(country %in% c("South Africa", "United States", "France")) %>%
  # then make sure R understands the the year variable is a data
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  # Then group the data by country and year
  group_by(country, year, issue) %>%
  # then take the average Yes votes for each country_year
  summarize(percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")) %>%
  # then make a nice plot
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~issue) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_color_manual( values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73")) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2019",
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  )
```

## Your Task {.smaller}

-   Make sure R and RStudio installed (we can help if needed)
-   Create a folder for this class somewhere on your machine
    -   Create a sub-folder called "classwork"
    -   Download and save [week1-classwork.qmd](https://gwu.box.com/s/5eqoce40wrz9edbtr91b6cwvwvq03e27) in that folder
-   Open the week1-classwork.qmd file in RStudio, which has code for 3 data viz activities
    -   Map making
    -   Democracy Over Time
    -   UN Voting patterns
-   Follow the instructions to update the code
-   Click the little green arrow to run the code chunk
-   Click Render to update your HTML output
-   Complete as much as you can (no problem if you do not finish)
